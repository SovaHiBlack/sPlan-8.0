<p><span class="rvts9">To graphically change or expand a component, simply open the Component-Editor.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Either click on the </span><span class="rvts11">Component-Editor</span><span class="rvts9"> button in the component properties, or simply </span><span class="rvts11">double-click</span><span class="rvts9"> on the component in your plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">To change a component directly in the component library, first double-click on the component in the library. the component is then highlighted in color and the component properties are displayed on the right edge of the window. Here you can call the editor with the component editor button. </span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/NewItem232.png"></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">If the Component-Editor is called up, the component is displayed directly on the work surface. In addition, the background color changes to light blue and a bar appears above the work area: </span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/NewItem233.png"></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">You can now freely edit the component here. All normal drawing functions are available to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The two fixed text elements </span><span class="rvts11">[ID]</span><span class="rvts9"> and </span><span class="rvts11">[Value]</span><span class="rvts9"> are shown here in square brackets. You can freely determine the position of these texts in relation to the component. You can also change the text properties (font, color, size) of these text elements. The only thing you cannot change here is the text itself. This is just a placeholder, so to speak, for the final texts in the drawing. These two items cannot be deleted either. If you do not want these to appear on your component, you can switch off the visibility of these text elements in the </span><a class="rvts10" href="ComponentProperties.htm">component properties</a><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">If you want to exit the component editor again, click either on </span><span class="rvts11">Save and Exit</span><span class="rvts9"> or on </span><span class="rvts11">Cancel</span><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">You will then automatically find yourself back on your drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts14">Contacts</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Another special feature of the component editor is the ability to define </span><a class="rvts10" href="Contacts.htm">contacts</a><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Contacts are actually nothing more than normal texts. However, contacts do not have a fixed text in the component, but you can edit the texts quickly and easily in the component properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Contacts are usually used to label or number the connections of a component. Of course, normal text can also be used for this. But if the connection names are not always the same, it makes sense to define them with contacts instead of normal texts. You only need to add the component to the library once. You can then change the texts of the connection designations directly in the properties of the component without having to open the component editor here.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">You have to pay attention to one particularly important point when creating a component: the </span><span class="rvts11">insertion point</span><span class="rvts9"> of the component.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts14">The insertion point / Red dot</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The insertion point is shown as a </span><span class="rvts25">red dot</span><span class="rvts9"> in the component editor. With this point you determine how the component is inserted into your drawing. A snap grid is always stored on the drawing, and this insertion point of the component is always on a grid point. Only with the correct determination of the insertion point is it possible to connect the various components on the drawing directly with one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Normally you always set the insertion point of a component directly on a connector. Please make sure that the insertion point is really EXACTLY on the connection. The easiest way to achieve this is when the connection and insertion point lie on one grid point. Then the accuracy is 100% guaranteed.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The grid setting in which you edit the component has no influence on how the component will later behave on the drawing. You can therefore set the grid at any time during editing as required, just as you need it.</span></p>

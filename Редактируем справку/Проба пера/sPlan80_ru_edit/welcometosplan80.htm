<P><SPAN class=rvts8>Welcome to sPlan 8.0</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts7></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>sPlan enables you to create drawings (or other drawings) 
easily and conveniently with the help of your computer. All components are 
simply dragged onto the drawing area and aligned. With the help of the saved 
snap grid, precise work is guaranteed at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>All components and drawing elements are included as 
independent elements on your drawing. You can group, move, rotate, copy, cut, 
paste, delete ...</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>In addition to the functions for drawing drawings, sPlan 
also provides you with other interesting options such as automatic component 
numbering or integrated component list management.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>Much emphasis was also placed on the print version. In the 
convenient print preview you can freely set the scaling, position the printout, 
etc. All changes are immediately visible in the print preview.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>The supplied component library can be expanded as required. 
You can set up completely new libraries and thus adapt and expand your component 
library according to your wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>The software was designed in such a way that it can be 
operated as simply and intuitively as possible. After a short training period, 
you will notice how easy it can be to create drawings quickly and 
conveniently.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN class=rvts11>Select</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>After you have drawn the elements you want, you can change 
them at any time. You can move them, change their size or shape, choose new 
colors, etc. To change an element, you must first select it. If you have not 
already done so, switch back to standard mode. Then simply click on the desired 
element with the mouse. If the element has no filling, e.g. a hollow circle, 
then please click on the edge of the element.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><IMG border=0 hspace=1 vspace=1 src="lib/NewItem192.png"></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>You can recognize selected elements at any time by their 
color scheme (</SPAN><SPAN class=rvts12>magenta</SPAN><SPAN class=rvts9>) and 
the small green/black box </SPAN><A class=rvts10 
href="SizerandChanger.htm">sizers</A><SPAN class=rvts9> around them.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts11>Select several elements</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>Sometimes it is necessary to select several elements at 
once. To do this, please click with the mouse on an empty space in the drawing. 
Then draw a frame with the mouse button still held down. When you let go of the 
mouse, all elements that lie within or only partially within the frame are 
selected.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>For particularly tricky selections, you can also work with 
the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key. If you keep this pressed, you can select all the desired 
elements one after the other with the mouse without losing the previous 
selection. You can also deselect a selected element by clicking on it. With 
these functions you can easily create complicated selections.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts11>Move</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>To move elements, they must first be selected. Then click 
with the mouse on one of the selected elements (please not on the sizer or 
changer) and move it with the mouse to the desired position. All other selected 
elements are also moved.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts13>Tip:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts13>You can also move the selected objects with the cursor 
keys on the keyboard. The elements are shifted by one grid point in the desired 
direction. With the &lt;CTRL&gt; key you can refine the grid by a factor of 10 
and thus position it more finely using the keyboard.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts13><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts11>Delete</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>To delete elements, they must first be selected. Then 
execute the "Delete" command. You can reach this either via the "Edit" menu or 
directly with the "DEL" key on the keyboard. Alternatively, you can also click 
the corresponding toolbar button. All selected elements will be removed from 
your drawing.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts11>Scaling, rotating and shearing</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=rvts9>Selected elements can be scaled (changed in size), 
compressed and stretched, rotated or sheared as required. You can do all of 
these functions easily with the mouse using the </SPAN><A class=rvts10 
href="SizerandChanger.htm">sizer and changer</A><SPAN class=rvts9>.</SPAN></P>

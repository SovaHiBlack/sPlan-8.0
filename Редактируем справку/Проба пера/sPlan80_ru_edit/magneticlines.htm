<p><span class="rvts9">You have the option of positioning so-called "magnetic lines" on the drawing. These can be helpful when creating the drawings. Magnetic lines are purely construction aids and are neither printed out, nor can they be edited in any way. You can create, move and delete these lines. The advantage of these lines is that they "magnetically attract" all elements. As soon as you move an element and with it come close to such a magnetic line, it will be attracted to it. This can be used to align several elements on exactly one line, for example. With several such lines, table-like structures could also be designed.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Insert new magnetic lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With the commands "New vertical magnetic line" and "New horizontal magnetic line" in the submenu </span><span class="rvts11">"Functions -&gt; Magnetic lines"</span><span class="rvts9"> you can create a new magnetic line. From there, these auxiliary lines can be moved as desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">You can also simply draw magnetic lines from the rulers more easily and quickly. Simply click on the ruler with the mouse, hold the mouse button down and drag a magnetic line onto the drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Moving magnetic lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">If you move the mouse over a magnetic line, the mouse pointer changes into a double arrow. This is the sign that you can move the magnetic line here. Click with the mouse on the corresponding magnetic line and then drag it to the desired position while holding the mouse button down.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Deleting magnetic lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">To delete an magnetic line, click with the mouse once on the magnetic line to be deleted. This will then turn red. With the command </span><span class="rvts11">"Delete"</span><span class="rvts9"> (menu "Edit" or toolbar) you can now delete this magnetic line again.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">You can delete magnetic lines more easily and quickly by simply dragging them onto a ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Fix magnetic lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With this function from the submenu </span><span class="rvts11">"Functions-&gt; Magnetic Lines"</span><span class="rvts9"> you can fix all magnetic lines on the drawing. These are then automatically protected against being moved and deleted. You cannot add new magnetic lines in this mode either. You can exit the mode at any time by selecting this function again.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Hide magnetic lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With this function from the submenu </span><span class="rvts11">"Functions-&gt; Magnetic Lines"</span><span class="rvts9"> you can hide all magnetic lines on the drawing. You cannot add new magnetic lines in this mode either. You can show the magnetic lines again at any time by selecting this function again.</span></p>

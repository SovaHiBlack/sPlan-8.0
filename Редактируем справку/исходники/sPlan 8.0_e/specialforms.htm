<p><span class="rvts9">The special forms are simple but often required and sometimes difficult to create elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Often these forms can also serve as a construction aid. For example, you can use an equilateral polygon as a construction aid to arrange solder points in an exact circular shape. To do this, simply create the polygon with the number of corners you want. Now place a soldering point on each corner and then delete the polygon again. You have already aligned your soldering points exactly in a circular shape. </span></p>

<p><span class="rvts11">Create a new Special form</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts7">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/NewItem23.png"><span class="rvts9"> Select the appropriate drawing mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">A pop-up menu opens and you can select the special form you want from the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With the first 4 special shapes, a dialog for setting special properties also appears: </span></p>
<p><span class="rvts7">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/NewItem205.png"></p>
<p><span class="rvts7"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With </span><span class="rvts11">polygon</span><span class="rvts9"> and </span><span class="rvts11">star</span><span class="rvts9"> you can choose whether the element should be created as a line or as a polygon. If the element is to be given a fill color, you must select </span><span class="rvts11">"as polygon"</span><span class="rvts9">.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">After selecting the special shape (and possibly confirming the dialog with OK), you can place the selected special shape on the drawing with the mouse. To do this, click with the mouse on the drawing to determine the starting point. Now, while still holding the mouse button down, draw a frame with the mouse to determine its size. When you release the mouse button, the special shape is created on the drawing. With some special shapes (such as arrows) you can influence the shape with the direction in which you open the frame (to the left / right or up / down).</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Change an existing special shape</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">After creating a special shape, it is created from the basic elements of sPlan (line, polygon, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">So changing these elements is the same as changing these simple basic elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The special properties that were selected when the special shape was created are no longer available after creation and cannot be changed afterwards. If necessary, the special shape can simply be deleted and a new one created. </span></p>

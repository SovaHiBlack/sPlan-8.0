<p><span class="rvts7">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">For those switching from version 7.0, there is a list of all the main innovations in sPlan 8.0:</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">New graphics engine</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">sPlan 8.0 now uses the modern Windows graphics engine (Direct2D). This results in a much better and also a considerably faster graphic output. Now you can zoom and navigate smoothly and smoothly even in more complex drawings, which makes working with sPlan much more convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">High resolution monitor support (high DPI scaling)</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">sPlan 8.0 now directly supports scaling on high-resolution monitors. sPlan adopts the scaling set in the Windows system and scales itself to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Properties panel</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With the new properties panel on the right edge of the window, all properties of elements can now be changed or viewed directly at any time. It is no longer necessary to call up a dialog by double-clicking. Any changes to a property are also immediately visible on your drawing. In this way you work even more effectively and intuitively.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">New component library</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The newly revised component library is now multi-level (with sub-categories). This allows the library to be sorted in a much more structured and clear manner. The entire library can now be backed up or a backup can be restored at the push of a button.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Unicode</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">sPlan now supports the full Unicode character set. This means that sPlan can display all characters, such as Greek letters or special mathematical characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Numeric entry</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Size specifications of individual elements such as circles or rectangles or position specifications can now also be specified numerically directly in the properties if required.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">New component lists</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Component lists can now be defined more precisely. In addition, if desired, component lists can be inserted directly into your page in a kind of table.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Table of Contents</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">If desired, a table of contents can be inserted directly into your drawing as a kind of table.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Angle snap when drawing lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">This function allows the lines to snap into place at 45 ° angles when drawing or editing. This enables you to automatically and intuitively create precisely aligned connections, even outside the set snap grid.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Bitmap functions</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">The resolution (dpi) of inserted bitmaps can now also be adjusted (reduced) directly in sPlan. A reasonable reduction can save a lot of storage space. There is also a bitmap explorer with which you can list all the bitmaps inserted in a project. This enables you to track down unnecessary "memory hogs".</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Text links / page references</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">There are now some new variables for automated designations available for creating text links or page references.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Conversions line &lt;&gt; polygon</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">Each line can now be converted into a polygon and each polygon can be converted into a line. That sounds unspectacular at first, but it is a very valuable aid for a lot of drawing work.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Hatching</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">sPlan 8.0 now uses its own hatching technique to fill elements. Hatching can now also be precisely defined with line width and line spacing. This new technique also eliminates any problems with hatching when printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Freehand lines</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">A new drawing mode allows you to easily draw freehand lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Page list</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">A new optional vertical page list makes it easier to navigate through the pages, especially for very large projects with more than 20 pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Hotkeys for the drawing modes</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With the (editable) hotkeys for the individual drawing modes, you can switch between the modes even faster if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">Full screen mode</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9">With the full screen mode you can display your drawing in full format without any window frames or other elements on the entire monitor. This can be particularly useful for presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts9"><br></span></p>
<p><span class="rvts11">... and many other functions and improvements</span></p>
